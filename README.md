## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 1 was to learn about information systems taht are very complicated and vast. The major components are hardware, software, data, people and processes. This summary includes the five components, client server architecture, cloud computing and a brief conclusion

## Information System Components
The five components are hardware, software, data, people and processes.
Hardware example-monitor
Software example-excel
Data example- individuals addresses or telephone numbers
People example- information management employees
Processes example-work flow diagrams.

### Client - Server Architecture
Is when many allowed users have access to networks from there PC. Permission needs to be given for access to these networks. The client server architecture best features are they allow a lot of information seamlessly to be shared with many users from their PC. An example of a common benefit of the client server architecture for a business office is that multiple employees can access Microsoft applications such as word and excel from their desktop PC by accessing these applications from their company network. Then as the ideas of sharing information between networks grew into the internet, world wide web and e-commerce. With growth of sharing information, it brought more concern of information security risks to light to individuals, corporations, and government. Git Hub is an example of a shared server whereby many can work and communicate on a project.

### Cloud Computing
Is the storage of information via the cloud. Cloud computing basically allows the use a network of remote serves hosted by the internet to store, manage, and process data rather than a local server or a personal computer. The use of cloud computing is evident by the increase in people using their phones for bankingâ€¦ etc. And an example of  individuals have transitioned to using cloud computing.

## Conclusion
Is that information systems are complicated and ever evolving. As information components, client server architecture and cloud computing continue to involve it is important to stay current with new information systems use and risks.
